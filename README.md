# Simple RNN made in python, with numpy
Hello (:, my name is semOpraque, and I am a junior python programmer

This is a code that makes a very simple neural network, 
that even a junior who knows a little bit of numpy can do.
Code made in pydroid 3, done in a day, out of boredom LOL.

The neural network has 3 calls, 1 input, 1 hidden and 1 output,
and in addition 1 neuron at the input, 6 at the hidden and 9 at the output.
Furthermore the type of training is back propagation, where the neural network "loses" point
(do not confuse with DQN) so it fits.
The goal of the neural network is to choose the same number that the user chooses,
simple? isn't it, then the hidden layer will serve as the neural network's memory,
so it's very simple for her to learn quickly.

You can test the code yourself in the Code folder, where the .py file is located.
